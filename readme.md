# What is PositiveCheck?

PositiveCheck includes a powerful natural language intelligence to detect bias and discrimination in online communication, and a robust and personalized web-based user experience to learn and address problematic communication.

Our product uses four key methods to identify bias in communication channels using a blend of Azure’s capabilities: 

* A custom-built predictive API built with Azure Machine Learning studio to classify hate or bias in social media speech.  
* Azure Cognitive Services for content moderation of flagged inappropriate or offensive language. 
* Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis of text as positive or negative in connotation. 
* Rules-based bias identification drawing from natural language processing literature.  

Our web application, hosted on Azure, powered by Flask, with a custom frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) demonstrates the capabilities of our algorithm in identifying and classifying discriminatory communication. Further, we present a robust resource center to equip users to understand their bias and a personal profile to showcase progress in one’s diversity and inclusivity journey.
